# DATA-606-Capstone
Repository for DataScience MPS Capstone project

This notebook is updated periodically as work progresses, please make sure you have the newest version.

capstone-phase1.ipynb loads the data set and performs exploratory analysis and feature selection in preparation for machine learning.

capstone-phase2.ipynb begins the exploration of ML modeling, after loading the data and apply transformations identified in phase 1.

-- The decision was made to split the exploration of different models into separate notebooks to avoid the notebook becoming too long.

capstone-phase2-svm.ipynb continues from capstone-phase2.ipynb with the exploration of SVM models.
